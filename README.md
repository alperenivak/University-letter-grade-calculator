# University-letter-grade-calculator
A simple but effective algorithm for beginners to print out students' letter grades based on the grades they received and whether they passed the course or not. With C language



The purpose of this project, which I uploaded to github to improve myself, is to see myself from the beginner level, to see the github algorithm and its functioning that I will constantly use in the industry, and to educate myself in this way.



The project simply uses the if else loop to obtain the student number, midterm grade, final grade and lab score from the user, and presents the user as an output whether he or she passed the course and with what letter grade, according to the letter grade ranges I defined and the entered scores.
